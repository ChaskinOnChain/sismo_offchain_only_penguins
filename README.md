## Overview

The goal of this project is to learn about working with the Sismo Connect Server Library in an offchain environment. The primary objective is to set up a private platform akin to OnlyFans, named "Only Penguins", where users holding a specific NFT, namely the Pudgy Penguins, receive a subscription discount based on the number of tokens they possess. This system leverages the power of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK Proofs) combined with offchain verification, ensuring that users can prove their NFT ownership without compromising their privacy or revealing the specifics of their holdings.
